    <p>
      This conversation from the Open Source Summit in Spain provides valuable
      insights into the significance of Delta Lake, the role of Rust in data
      engineering, and the collaborative nature of open source communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Delta Lake open source project integrates data lakes and data
      warehouses, a needed combination in this new age of scale-out data
      requiring reliability and controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      A data lakehouse integrates the advanced data analytics and low-cost
      storage of a data lake with the performance and reliability of a data
      warehouse, said Florian Valeye, a data engineer with Back Market, in this
      episode of The New Stack Makers, recorded at the Open Source Summit in
      Bilbao, Spain, earlier this fall.

      <p>
        The data warehouse is an approach that emerged over the past two
        decades. It consists of structured data models that allow for better
        performance. The datasets are small and constrained, Valeye said. In
        contrast, the data lake consists of unstructured data from multiple
        sources . The volume size of data lakes reaches petabytes or even
        exabytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delta Lake, created by Databricks, breaks down the barriers between data
        warehouses and data lakes by providing more performance and features in
        the data lake, Valeye said.
      </p>
      <p>
        ACID transactions are a staple of a data warehouse, Valeye said. When
        thinking about the relational database or a data warehouse, a focus is
        put on model representations and the data structure. A data lake is an
        open way to push data and add a schema. Data lakes magnify data. Through
        the “wall breaking,” the lake house provides ACID transactions, Read,
        Process, Interpret (RPI) ingestions, and metadata scalability. The
        strength comes with a way to attain knowledge for any usage without a
        barrier between the data analyst side of the house and the data
        engineering and data scientist teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Databricks is now working on providing ways for anyone to contribute
        their connectors through Delta Lake, allowing gateways that can be used
        with, for example, different databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        “And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really nice when you are working on a
        specific cloud provider; you don&rsquo;t want to be bundled, locked
        inside it,” Valerie said. “So that&rsquo;s why having this kind of
        standard format, you can switch and move from one to another, and
        don&rsquo;t feel stuck with one provider and one format.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Valeye said Back Market sells refurbished devices. To determine device
        quality, the company developed an algorithm to determine whether a
        device is viable for sale. Back Market uses Delta Lake to ingest data
        from APIs and other data sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delta Lake is a platform to connect data scientists and data engineers,
        said Valeye, who previously worked as a data engineer. Before using
        Delta Lake, deploying models could be complicated due to the
        complexities of the different tools and programming languages used. The
        Delta Lake infrastructure closes the gaps. It allows everyone to work on
        the same infrastructure.
