      <h5>Project Governance</h5>
      <p>
        Delta Lake is an independent open-source project and not controlled by
        any single company. To emphasize this we joined the Delta Lake Project
        in 2019, which is a sub-project of the Linux Foundation Projects. Within
        the project, we make decisions based on <a
          href="https://delta.io/pdfs/delta-charter.pdf"
          target="_blank">these rules</a
        >.
