## Contributing

Maybe get rid of this section since contributing has its own menu item

Contribute and collaborate with fellow Delta Lake users and contributors, ask questions, and share tips.

- [Getting Help](/community/getting-help)
- [Contributing to Documentation](/community/contributing-to-docs)

## Featured Contributors

Only include full set page after docs are moved over and contribute has its own dropdown

Fix the below set

<GithubContributorsGrid
  users={[
    "zsxwing",
    "brkyvz",
    "tdas",
    "rahulsmahadev",
    "josetorres",
    "liwensun",
  ]}
/>

## Community Meetings

Only include full set page after docs are moved over and contribute has its own dropdown maybe not even then

<JsonCardDataList data="meetings" first={3} />

## Organizations

Why not just have the full set here?

<OrganizationTiles columns={{ xs: 3, md: 4, lg: 6 }} />
