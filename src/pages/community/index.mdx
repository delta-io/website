## Governance

Delta Lake is an independent open-source project and not controlled by any single company. To emphasize this we joined the Delta Lake Project in 2019, which is a sub-project of the Linux Foundation Projects. Within the project, we make decisions based on [these rules](https://delta.io/pdfs/delta-charter.pdf).

Delta Lake is supported by a wide set of developers from over 70 organizations across multiple repositories. Since 2019, more than 190 developers have contributed to Delta Lake across more than 5 repositories! The Delta Lake community is growing by leaps and bounds with more than 5500 members in the [Delta Users slack](https://go.delta.io/delta-users)).
