---

The following are quick start steps to work with Delta Lake using a JupyterLab notebook.

### JupyterLab Notebook

1. Open a bash shell (if on windows use git bash, WSL, or any shell configured for bash commands)

2. Run a container from the image with a JuypterLab entrypoint

   ```bash
   # Build entry point
   docker run --name delta_quickstart --rm -it -p 8888-8889:8888-8889 delta_quickstart
   ```

   ```bash
   # Image entry point (M1)
   docker run --name delta_quickstart --rm -it -p 8888-8889:8888-8889 -entrypoint bash deltaio/delta-docker:latest_arm64
   ```

3. Running the above command gives a JupyterLab notebook URL, copy that URL and launch a browser to follow along the notebook and run each cell.

  You may also launch the pyspark or scala shells after launching a terminal in
  JupyterLab
