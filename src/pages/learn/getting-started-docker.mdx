title: Getting Started with Delta Lake - Docker
width: full
---

This guide contains instructions and materials to get started with Delta Lake and work through the quickstart materials using a self-contained Docker image. This section focuses on building and working with the Delta Lake docker image.

<Info title="Note">
  The basic prerequisite for following along using Delta Lake Docker image is
  having Docker installed on your machine. Please follow the steps from the
  Docker website to install Docker locally. Based on your local machine
  operating system, please choose the appropriate option listed on the [Get
  Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) page.
</Info>

Follow the steps below to build an Apache Spark<sup>TM</sup> image with Delta
Lake installed, run a container, and follow the quickstart in an interactive
notebook or shell with any of the options like Python, PySpark, Scala Spark or Rust.

- [Docker Hub](#docker-hub): Download the Delta Lake docker and get started fast!
- [Build the image](#build-the-image): Follow these instructions if you want to build your own docker image.

<Info title="Note">
  Python version available in this Docker image is 3.9.2 and is available as
  `python3`.
</Info>

### Docker Hub

To get started quickly, you can also download the image from DockerHub at [Delta Lake DockerHub](https://go.delta.io/dockerhub). Note, there are different versions of the Delta Lake docker

| Tag               | Platform | Python | Rust   | Delta-Spark | Spark | JupyterLab | Pandas | ROAPI |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ---------- | ------ | ----- |
| 0.8.1_2.3.0       | amd64    | 0.8.1  | latest | 2.3.0       | 3.3.2 | 3.6.3      | 1.5.3  | 0.9.0 |
| 0.8.1_2.3.0_arm64 | arm64    | 0.8.1  | latest | 2.3.0       | 3.3.2 | 3.6.3      | 1.5.3  | 0.9.0 |
| latest            | amd64    | 0.9.0  | latest | 2.3.0       | 3.3.2 | 3.6.3      | 1.5.3  | 0.9.0 |
| latest            | arm64    | 0.9.0  | latest | 2.3.0       | 3.3.2 | 3.6.3      | 1.5.3  | 0.9.0 |

<Info title="Note">
  The arm64 version is built for ARM64 platforms like Mac M1
</Info>

Download the appropriate tag, e.g.:

- `docker pull deltaio/delta-docker:latest` for the standard Linux docker
- `docker pull deltaio/delta-docker:latest_arm64` for running this optimally on your Mac M1

#### Image Entry Point

Your entry point for the Docker Hub image is:

```bash
# Running locally on Mac M1
docker run --name delta_quickstart --rm -it --entrypoint bash deltaio/delta-docker:latest_arm64
```

```bash
# Running on Linux VM
docker run --name delta_quickstart --rm -it --entrypoint bash deltaio/delta-docker:latest
```

Once the image has been built or you have downloaded the correct image, you can then move on to running the quickstart in a notebook or shell.

### Build the Image

You can also build your own docker image locally if you want to test out different versions of Delta Lake, Apache Sparkâ„¢, Rust, Python, or other APIs.

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the cloned folder
3. Navigate to the `quickstart_docker` folder
4. Open a bash shell (if on windows use git bash, WSL, or any shell configured for bash commands)
5. Execute the following from the `static/quickstart_docker` folder

   ```bash
   docker build -t delta_quickstart -f Dockerfile_delta_quickstart .
   ```

#### Build Entry Point

Your entry point for this locally built docker file is

```bash
docker run --name delta_quickstart --rm -it --entrypoint bash delta_quickstart
```
