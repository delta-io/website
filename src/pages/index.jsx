              <>
                Data lakes typically have multiple data pipelines reading and
                writing data concurrently, and data engineers have to go through
                a tedious process to ensure data integrity, due to the lack of
                transactions. Delta Lake brings ACID transactions to your data
                lakes. It provides serializability, the strongest level of
                isolation level. Learn more at{" "}
