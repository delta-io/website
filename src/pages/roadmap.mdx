**[Roadmap of highest priority issues across the Delta Lake ecosystem](https://github.com/orgs/delta-io/projects/10/views/1)**

Delta Lake is a vast ecosystem of several code repositories. Here's the list of mature projects:

- Delta on Spark, Delta on Flink, Delta on Hive, Delta Kernel Java, Delta Standalone - [delta-io/delta](https://github.com/delta-io/delta)
- Delta Rust - [delta-io/delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs)
- Delta Sharing - [delta-io/delta-sharing](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing)
- Delta on Kafka - [delta-io/delta-kafka-ingest](https://github.com/delta-io/kafka-delta-ingest)
- Delta on Trino - [trinodb/trino](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/tree/master/plugin/trino-delta-lake/)
- Delta on Presto - [prestodb/presto](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/tree/master/presto-delta)
- Delta website (delta.io) - [delta-io/website](https://github.com/delta-io/website)

In addition, there are experimental projects that are incubating under the [delta-incubator Github organization](https://github.com/delta-incubator/). These projects will be promoted to the [delta-io GitHub organization](https://github.com/delta-io/) when they're sufficiently mature. Here's the list of incubating projects:

- [riverbank](https://github.com/delta-incubator/riverbank)
- [dat](https://github.com/delta-incubator/dat)
- [deltaray](https://github.com/delta-incubator/deltaray)
- [delta-sharing-connectors](https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-sharing-connectors)

We encourage you to look at the open issues and contribute.

You can also feel free to message us in Slack if you have an idea for a new project. We're always happy to start incubating good new ideas that will be valuable for the Delta Lake community.
