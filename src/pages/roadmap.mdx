Delta Lake is a vast ecosystem of several code repositories. The roadmaps for each project can be found in the GitHub issues / milestones of the respective repository.

- [delta-io/delta](https://github.com/delta-io/delta)
- [delta-io/delta-sharing](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing)
- [delta-io/delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs)
- [delta-io/connectors](https://github.com/delta-io/connectors)
- [delta-io/website](https://github.com/delta-io/website)
- [delta-io/delta-kafka-ingest](https://github.com/delta-io/kafka-delta-ingest)

The Delta Lake ecosystem also has a variety of projects that are incubating. These projects are promoted to the [delta-io](https://github.com/delta-io/) GitHub organization when they're sufficiently mature. Here's the list of incubating projects:

- [riverbank](https://github.com/delta-incubator/riverbank)
- [dat](https://github.com/delta-incubator/dat)
- [deltaray](https://github.com/delta-incubator/deltaray)
- [delta-sharing-connectors](https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-sharing-connectors)

We encourage you to look at the open issues and contribute.

You can also feel free to message us in Slack if you have an idea for a new project. We're always happy to start incubating good new ideas that will be valuable for the Delta Lake community.
