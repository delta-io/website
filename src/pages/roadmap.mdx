<Info title="Important" level="info">
  The following is the Delta Lake 2022 H2 Roadmap; for the latest updates,
  comments, and discussions; please refer to the [Github
  source](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1307).
</Info>

<br />

This is a **working issue** for folks to provide feedback on the prioritization of the Delta Lake priorities spanning July to December 2022. With the release of Delta Lake 2.0, we wanted to take the opportunity to discuss other vital features for prioritization with the community based on the feedback from the Delta Users [Slack](https://go.delta.io/slack), [Google Groups](https://go.delta.io/groups), Community AMAs (on [Delta Lake YouTube](https://go.delta.io/youtube)), the [Roadmap 2022H2 (discussion)](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1307), and more.

<Info title="Note" level="info">
  - Tasks that are crossed out (i.e., ~00~) have been completed. - We're
  currently clarifying the Delta Rust roadmap, please refer to [this
  document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKVdnilMCS6qziBBVohXw2-UX_Ld2K6AAjLTZHcYhQ0/edit#)
  for more information.
