    "title": "Cinco de Trino > Building Reliable Lakehouses with Delta Lake",
    "description": "Data Lakehouses combines the best of both worlds for databases and data lakes. Databases provide relative simplicity and ACID transactional protection for your data while data lakes provide flexibility, scalability, and support for non-structured data on cheap object stores. In this session, we describe Delta Lake, which brings reliability by providing a transactional layer on top of data lakes. We will talk about key features of Delta Lake that enable the Lakehouse Architecture. Finally, we will talk about the work we are doing to build the ecosystem around Delta Lake including supporting multiple languages (Python, Rust, Java, etc) as well as data processing systems such as Trino, Apache Flink, and Apache Sparkâ„¢.",
