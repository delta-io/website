## Upcoming Events

### Diving into Delta Lake: Unpacking the Transaction Log

_March 26th, 2020_

![](./unpacking-the-transaction-log.png)

The transaction log is key to understanding Delta Lake because it is the common thread that runs through many of its most important features, including ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, time travel, and more. In this session, we'll explore what the Delta Lake transaction log is, how it works at the file level, and how it offers an elegant solution to the problem of multiple concurrent reads and writes.\

### Diving into Delta Lake: Enforcing and Evolving the Schema

_April 2nd, 2020_

![](./schema-enforcement-and-evolution.png)

As business problems and requirements evolve over time, so to does the structure of your data. With Delta Lake, as the data changes, incorporating new dimensions is easy. Users have access to simple semantics to control the schema of their tables. These tools include schema enforcement, which prevents users from accidentally polluting their tables with mistakes or garbage data, as well as schema evolution, which enables them to automatically add new columns of rich data when those columns belong. In this webinar, we'll dive into the use of these tools.\

### Diving into Delta Lake: DML Internals

_April 16th, 2020_

In the earlier Delta Lake Internals webinar series sessions, we described how the Delta Lake transaction log works. In this session, we will dive deeper into how commits, snapshot isolation, and partition and files change when performing deletes, updates, merges, and structured streaming.
