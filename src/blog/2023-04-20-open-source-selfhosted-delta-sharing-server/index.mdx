My name is Shingo, creator of [Kotosiro Sharing](https://github.com/kotosiro/sharing). I am excited to announce the release of [Kotosiro Sharing](https://github.com/kotosiro/sharing), a minimalistic Rust implementation of the Delta Sharing server aimed at helping engineers easily host their own Delta Sharing service.
In this article, I will provide instructions on how to share your data with your colleagues who may have varying technical backgrounds, ranging from data engineers to business intelligence analysts, using self-hosted [Kotosiro Sharing](https://github.com/kotosiro/sharing) server. The instructions are fairly easy and straightforward, and you can easily share your data with colleagues who have different levels of technical expertise. The implementation is currently in the beta phase, and hence, it does not provide a GUI yet. However, this feature will be added in the near future.
The following image depicts the system workflow. Let's walk through how [Kotosiro Sharing](https://github.com/kotosiro/sharing) works when you want to share precious data with your colleagues.

### Delta Table Structure

You have [historical data on avocado prices and sales volume in multiple US markets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices) stored in your Delta table on AWS S3. Your colleague has come to your desk and asked if they could use the data for further data analytics. The structure of the table is as follows:

```

2 directories, 16 files
```

The table is partitioned using the `year` column, and each partition is appended sequentially. Therefore, the table has [four different versions](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/history.html) in chronological order.

### Log in to Kotosiro Sharing Server and Get the Admin Access Token

Now let's get started with the interesting part. As the owner of the data and administrator of your [Kotosiro Sharing](https://github.com/kotosiro/sharing) server, you need to log in to the system and obtain the admin access token. This token will enable you to create a [share](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md#concepts). Here's how you can obtain the token:

```
 $ curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/login \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"account": "kotosiro", "password": "password"}' \
        | jq '.'
{
  "profile": {
    "shareCredentialsVersion": 1,
    "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
    "bearerToken": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoia290b3Npcm8iLCJlbWFpbCI6ImtvdG9zaXJvQGVtYWlsLmNvbSIsIm5hbWVzcGFjZSI6ImFkbWluIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZXhwIjoxNjgxOTM3NzMyfQ.rVjA6S7EWq7CakpB0IHik0mvxl58ynZNxNM3a3RJibY",
    "expirationTime": "2023-04-19 20:55:32 UTC"
  }
}
```
