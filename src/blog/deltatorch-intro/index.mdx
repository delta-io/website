PyTorch has become the deep learning framework of choice in many applications. But managing data loading pipelines for PyTorch can be challenging, especially in a production environment with datasets that may evolve over time. Maintaining and accessing earlier versions of training data can be difficult and costly; concurrent reads and writes can disrupt training jobs; and large datasets can result in significant performance overhead.

[DeltaTorch](https://github.com/delta-incubator/deltatorch) enables PyTorch DataLoaders to seamlessly use Delta tables as a data source. These DataLoaders handle the batching, sampling, and multiprocessing of data during PyTorch training pipelines, without requiring a temporary copy of the Delta tables.

Delta Lake, an open format storage layer that uses the fast Parquet file format along with a transaction log, can mitigate these issues and improve reliability and performance of training data. Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unified streaming/batch data processing on top of blob storage like S3 or ADLS. This can provide many advantages to PyTorch users:

- Snapshot isolation ensures concurrent writes do not impact training jobs reading data.
- Full history and rollback allows accessing previous versions of the dataset for model retraining or comparison.
- Performance optimization like data skipping, caching, and predicate pushdown accelerate training.
- Unified batch and streaming ingestion simplifies the data pipeline.

The [DeltaTorch](https://github.com/delta-incubator/deltatorch) library unlocks the benefits of Delta Lake for PyTorch by providing the means to create PyTorch DataLoaders from Delta tables. This post shows how to create a PyTorch DataLoader from the MNIST dataset saved in the Delta Lake format, and how to use the DataLoader to train a simple CNN model (the "hello, world" of deep learning).

## Setup

### Installing DeltaTorch

You can install DeltaTorch with pip via `pip install git+https://github.com/delta-incubator/deltatorch`. It requires Python version > 3.8.

### Starting a Spark Session

The code snippet below configures a PySpark session with Delta Lake support. We will use this to save/load an example Delta table. Note that some runtime environments, such as Databricks, configure the Spark session for you so you don't need to do it yourself.

```python
import pyspark
from delta import *

builder = (
    pyspark.sql.SparkSession.builder.appName("deltatorch-example")
    .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension")
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog")
)

spark = configure_spark_with_delta_pip(builder).getOrCreate()
```

## Getting the data and saving it as a Delta table

We download the mnist dataset using `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` and save it as a Delta table.

There are a couple of things to note in our handling of the data:

- We add a unique id field to the data. This is required as DeltaTorch uses the id field for sharding and parallel data loading.
- We convert the images from PIL Images to numpy arrays and then save them as bytearrays. The DataLoader we define will include logic for converting them to tensors.

```python
from torchvision import datasets
from pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, StructType, StructField, FloatType, BinaryType
import numpy as np

train_set = datasets.MNIST(root="./data", train=True, download=True)
test_set = datasets.MNIST(root="./data", train=False, download=True)

schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", IntegerType(), False),
    StructField("label", FloatType(), False),
    StructField("features", BinaryType(), False),
])

schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", IntegerType(), False),
    StructField("label", FloatType(), False),
    StructField("features", BinaryType(), False),  # Changed ArrayType(IntegerType()) to BinaryType()
])

# Convert images to numpy arrays and save as binary
train_data = [
    (i, float(y), bytearray(np.array(x))) for i, (x, y) in enumerate(train_set)
]

train_df = spark.createDataFrame(train_data, schema).repartition(50)

test_data = [
    (i, float(y), bytearray(np.array(x))) for i, (x, y) in enumerate(test_set)
]

test_df = spark.createDataFrame(test_data, schema).repartition(50)

# Write the DataFrame to Delta Lake format
train_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save(
    "./data/mnist_delta/train"
)

test_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("./data/mnist_delta/test")
```

Now that we've saved the image data as a Delta table, let's make sure we can retrieve the images.

```python
# Preview one of the images
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Read from the delta table
train_df_from_delta = spark.read.format("delta").load(
    "./data/mnist_delta/train"
)

# Preview one of the images
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Select one row from the DataFrame
row = train_df_from_delta.filter(train_df_from_delta.id == 7).first()

# Extract the image data and label
image_data = row["features"]
label = row["label"]

# Convert the binary data back to a NumPy array and reshape it
image_array = np.frombuffer(image_data, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(28, 28)

# Plot the image
plt.imshow(image_array, cmap="gray")
plt.title(f"Label: {label}")
plt.show()
```

Which returns:

!["The number three"](./image1.png)

We have no problem retrieving the image array from the Delta table. Now we're ready to define PyTorch DataLoaders using these Delta tables as data sources.

## Defining DataLoaders with DeltaTorch

The DeltaTorch library exposes one key method: `deltatorch.create_data_loader`. This method allows you to specify the path to the Delta table, the id field, the data fields to load, and [various other configuration options](https://github.com/delta-incubator/deltatorch/blob/4346c313dc194b1222cbc799ce386776fd964120/deltatorch/pytorch.py#L10).

As mentioned, we need to include some logic for transforming the bytearray representations of the images to tensors. We accomplish this by creating the following callable Python class. We create it in a separate `utils.py` file so everything works as expected when working with Jupyter notebooks. When using multi-processing with Jupyter notebooks, locally defined classes aren't serializable. By moving the `BinaryToFloatTensor` class to a separate file (`utils.py`), we ensure it can be pickled and thus used in a multi-processing context.

```python
# utils.py
import numpy as np
import torch

class BinaryToFloatTensor(object):

    def __call__(self, pic):
        """
        Convert a byte buffer representation of an image to a float tensor.

        Args:
            pic (bytes): A byte buffer representing an image.

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: A float tensor representing the image.
        """
        np_array = np.frombuffer(pic, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(28, 28).copy()
        return torch.from_numpy(np_array).float()
```

Now we can import this class and define the PyTorch DataLoader.

```python
from deltatorch import create_pytorch_dataloader, FieldSpec
from utils import BinaryToFloatTensor

def create_data_loader(path: str, batch_size: int):
    return create_pytorch_dataloader(
        path,
        id_field="id",
        fields=[
            FieldSpec("features", transform=BinaryToFloatTensor()),
            FieldSpec("label"),
        ],
        num_workers=4,
        shuffle=True,
        batch_size=batch_size,
    )
```

This function takes a path to a Delta table and a batch size and returns a PyTorch DataLoader. We can use it to create a DataLoader from the training data we saved as a Delta table using the following snippet:

```python
train_dl = create_data_loader("./data/mnist_delta/train",
                             batch_size=32)
```

Which gives us a ready-to-use PyTorch DataLoader:

```python
> type(train_dl)

torch.utils.data.dataloader.DataLoader
```

## Example Training Loop

Now let's put the DataLoader to work! We'll train a simple CNN on the MNIST data.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from tqdm import tqdm

# Define the network architecture
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 14 * 14, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.maxpool(x)
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 14 * 14) # Flatten the tensor
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Create the network, loss function and optimizer
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = SimpleCNN().to(device)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the network
for epoch in range(3): # Loop over the dataset multiple times
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    progress = tqdm(enumerate(train_dl), total=len(train_dl))
    for i, data in progress:
        # Get the inputs; data is a list of [inputs, labels]
        inputs, labels = data["features"], data["label"]
        inputs = inputs.unsqueeze(1).to(device) # Add an extra dimension for the single channel (grayscale)
        labels = labels.to(device)
        # Zero the parameter gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        # Forward + backward + optimize
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels.long()) # Use long() to ensure the labels are of the correct type
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        # Accuracy
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels.long()).sum().item()
        if (i + 1) % 100 == 0: # Print training accuracy every 100 batches
            acc = 100 * correct / total
            progress.set_description(f"Loss: {loss.item():.4f}, Accuracy: {acc:.2f}%")
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss (Train): {loss.item():.4f}, Accuracy (Train): {acc:.2f}%")
```

Which returns:

```text
Loss: 0.0001, Accuracy: 94.12%: : 1876it [00:33, 55.81it/s]
Epoch 1, Loss (Train): 0.0693, Accuracy (Train): 94.12%

Loss: 0.0136, Accuracy: 97.40%: : 1876it [00:33, 56.84it/s]
Epoch 2, Loss (Train): 0.0031, Accuracy (Train): 97.40%

Loss: 0.0009, Accuracy: 97.89%: : 1876it [00:33, 55.79it/s]
Epoch 3, Loss (Train): 0.0004, Accuracy (Train): 97.89%
```

Now we can create a DataLoader from our test data Delta table and check the test accuracy.

```python
test_dl = create_data_loader("./data/mnist_delta/test",
                            batch_size=32)

# Function to calculate accuracy

def calculate_accuracy(y_pred, y_test):
    _, predicted = torch.max(y_pred, 1)
    total = y_test.size(0)
    correct = (predicted == y_test).sum().item()
    return correct / total

model.eval() # Set the model to evaluation mode
total_accuracy = 0
with torch.no_grad(): # We don't need gradients for evaluation
    progress = tqdm(enumerate(test_dl), total=len(test_dl))
    for i, data in progress:
        inputs, labels = data["features"], data["label"]
        inputs = inputs.unsqueeze(1).to(device) # Add an extra dimension for the single channel (grayscale)
        labels = labels.to(device)
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(inputs)
        # Calculate accuracy
        acc = calculate_accuracy(outputs, labels.long()) # Use long() to ensure the labels are of the correct type
        total_accuracy += acc
        # progress.set_description(f"Accuracy: {acc*100:.2f}%")
    # Calculate average accuracy over the entire test set
    average_accuracy = total_accuracy / len(test_dl)
    print(f"Average test accuracy: {average_accuracy*100:.2f}%")
```

Which returns

```text
Average test accuracy: 97.32%
```
