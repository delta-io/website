## Key features

We are excited to announce the release of Delta Lake 0.5.0, which introduces Presto/Athena support and improved concurrency. The key features in this release are:

- **Support for other processing engines using manifest files ([#76](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/76))** - You can now query Delta tables from Presto and Amazon Athena using manifest files, which you can generate using Scala, Java, Python, and SQL APIs. See the [documentation](https://docs.delta.io/0.5.0/presto-integration.html) for details.
- **Improved concurrency for all Delta Lake operations ([#9](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/9), [#72](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/72), [#228](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/228))** - You can now run more Delta Lake operations concurrently. Delta Lake's optimistic concurrency control has been improved by making conflict detection more fine-grained. This makes it easier to run complex workflows on Delta tables. For example:
  - Running deletes (e.g. for GDPR compliance) concurrently on older partitions while newer partitions are being appended.
  - Running updates and merges concurrently on disjoint sets of partitions.
  - Running file compactions concurrently with appends (see below).See the [documentation on concurrency control](https://docs.delta.io/0.5.0/concurrency-control.html) for more details.
- **Improved support for file compaction ([#146](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/146))** - You can now compact files by rewriting them with the `DataFrameWriter` option `dataChange` set to `false`. This option allows a compaction operation to run concurrently with other batch and streaming operations. See [this example in the documentation](https://docs.delta.io/0.5.0/best-practices.html#compact-files) for details.
- **Improved performance for insert-only merge ([#246](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/246))** - Delta Lake now provides more optimized performance for merge operations that have only insert clauses and no update clauses. Furthermore, Delta Lake ensures that writes from such insert-only merges only append new data to the table. Hence, you can now use Structured Streaming and insert-only merges to do continuous deduplication of data (e.g. logs). See [this example in the documentation](https://docs.delta.io/0.5.0/delta-update.html#-merge-in-dedup) for details.
- **SQL Support for Convert-to-Delta ([#175](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/175))** - You can now use SQL to convert a Parquet table to Delta (Scala, Java, and Python were already supported in 0.4.0). See the [documentation](https://docs.delta.io/0.5.0/delta-utility.html#convert-to-delta) for details.
- **Experimental support for Snowflake and Redshift Spectrum** - You can now query Delta tables from Snowflake and Redshift Spectrum. This support is considered experimental in this release. See the [documentation](https://docs.delta.io/0.5.0/integrations.html) for details.
