Scribd has made many excellent contributions to the Delta Lake ecosystem including connectors that make it easy to read data from various sources into Delta Lakes.

This talk discusses the [kafka-delta-ingest](https://github.com/delta-io/kafka-delta-ingest) connector that enabled Scribd to reduce data ingestion costs by 95%.
